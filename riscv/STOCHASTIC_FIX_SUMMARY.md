# RISC-V Stochastic Search Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The RISC-V stochastic search implementation was missing critical components that ARM had:

### Key Differences Found:
1. **No mutation distribution**: RISC-V didn't set `mutate-dist` hash to control mutation type frequencies
2. **No mutate-opcode override**: ARM has custom opcode mutation logic, RISC-V was using defaults
3. **Missing inherited fields**: RISC-V wasn't inheriting `stat`, `mutate-dist`, and `live-in` fields
4. **No debug support**: RISC-V wasn't getting debug field from machine

## Fix Applied
Updated `/home/allenjin/Codes/greenthumb_jerry/riscv/riscv-stochastic.rkt`:

```racket
;; Added mutation distribution (controls frequency of each mutation type)
(set! mutate-dist
      #hash((opcode . 2) (operand . 1) (swap . 1) (instruction . 1)))

;; Added custom mutate-opcode implementation
(define/override (mutate-opcode index entry p)
  ;; Custom RISC-V opcode mutation logic
  ...)

;; Properly inherited required fields
(inherit-field machine stat mutate-dist live-in)
```

## Current Status
- **Fixed**: Stochastic class now matches ARM's structure
- **Runs**: No more errors when running optimizer
- **Issue**: Still experiencing timeouts or not finding alternatives

## Potential Remaining Issues
1. **Validator**: The validator might be rejecting valid alternatives
2. **Test generation**: The validator needs good test cases to verify equivalence
3. **Machine configuration**: RISC-V machine class might have issues
4. **Cost model integration**: The simulators might not be using cost models correctly

## Recommendation
The stochastic search implementation structure is now correct (matching ARM), but there appear to be deeper issues with:
- The RISC-V validator's test generation
- The overall optimization framework integration
- Possible infinite loops in the search process

These issues are likely in other components beyond the stochastic search itself.
