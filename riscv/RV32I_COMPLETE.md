## Key Implementation Details

### AUIPC Implementation
- Tracks program counter (PC) during execution
- Each instruction increments PC by 4 bytes
- AUIPC adds (immediate << 12) to current PC
- Useful for position-independent code and large constants

### x0 Register Convention
- All writes to x0 are ignored
- x0 always reads as 0
- Enforced at the end of each instruction execution

### Shift Instructions
- Shift amounts are masked to 5 bits (0-31 range)
- Arithmetic right shift preserves sign bit
- Logical right shift fills with zeros

### Comparison Instructions
- Return 1 if condition is true, 0 if false
- Support both signed and unsigned comparisons
- Work with both register and immediate operands

## Testing
All instructions have been verified with comprehensive test cases including:
- Edge cases (overflow, underflow, sign extension)
- Boundary values (max/min integers)
- Special cases (division by zero, x0 register)

## Usage in Superoptimizer
These instructions provide a complete arithmetic and logical instruction set suitable for:
- Computational kernels
- Cryptographic primitives
- Signal processing algorithms
- Mathematical computations
- Bit manipulation routines

The absence of branches keeps the code straight-line, which is ideal for superoptimization as it avoids the complexity of control flow graph analysis and path explosion.
