# RV32M Extension Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully added all 7 RV32M (Integer Multiply/Divide) extension instructions to the RISC-V implementation.

## Instructions Added

### Multiplication High (3 instructions)
1. **MULH rd, rs1, rs2** - Multiply high (signed×signed)
   - Returns upper 32 bits of 64-bit signed product
   - Uses efficient `smmul` function from ARM implementation

2. **MULHU rd, rs1, rs2** - Multiply high (unsigned×unsigned)
   - Returns upper 32 bits of 64-bit unsigned product
   - Uses efficient `ummul` function from ARM implementation

3. **MULHSU rd, rs1, rs2** - Multiply high (signed×unsigned)
   - Returns upper 32 bits of mixed-sign product
   - Custom implementation for signed×unsigned case

### Division (2 instructions)
4. **DIV rd, rs1, rs2** - Signed division
   - Special cases per RISC-V spec:
     - Division by zero: returns -1
     - Overflow (-2³¹ ÷ -1): returns -2³¹

5. **DIVU rd, rs1, rs2** - Unsigned division
   - Special case: Division by zero returns 2³²-1

### Remainder (2 instructions)
6. **REM rd, rs1, rs2** - Signed remainder
   - Special cases:
     - Division by zero: returns dividend
     - Overflow: returns 0

7. **REMU rd, rs1, rs2** - Unsigned remainder
   - Special case: Division by zero returns dividend

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **riscv-machine.rkt**
   - Added new instructions to instruction classes
   - `mulh`, `mulhu` as commutative operations
   - `mulhsu`, `div`, `divu`, `rem`, `remu` as non-commutative

2. **riscv-simulator-rosette.rkt**
   - Implemented symbolic simulation for all RV32M instructions
   - Uses bitvector operations for symbolic execution
   - Handles type conversion between bitvectors and integers

3. **riscv-simulator-racket.rkt**
   - Implemented concrete simulation for all RV32M instructions
   - Direct arithmetic operations for efficiency
   - Proper handling of signed/unsigned conversions

### Performance Optimizations

Following ARM's approach, multiplication high operations use efficient algorithms:
- **smmul**: Optimized signed multiplication high
- **ummul**: Optimized unsigned multiplication high

These split operands into halves and perform partial products, avoiding full 64-bit multiplication where possible. This is critical for symbolic execution performance.

## Testing

All instructions tested and verified:
- ✅ Basic arithmetic correctness
- ✅ Special cases (division by zero, overflow)
- ✅ Signed/unsigned handling
- ✅ Integration with superoptimizer

## Current Instruction Count

### Total: 27 instructions
- **RV32I Base**: 19 instructions
- **RV32M Extension**: 8 instructions (MUL + 7 new)

The implementation now supports a complete set of arithmetic operations for RV32IM, suitable for superoptimization of compute-intensive code without memory operations.
