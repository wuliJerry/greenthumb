# Optimization Test Results

## Summary
The superoptimizer infrastructure is complete and functional, but the search algorithms need tuning to find better optimizations. The current implementation can verify equivalence but struggles to discover optimizations automatically.

## Test Programs Created

### 1. **multiply_by_3.s** (2 instructions)
```assembly
add x2, x1, x1    # x2 = 2*x1
add x2, x2, x1    # x2 = 3*x1
```
**Potential optimization**: Could use shift+add but same cost (2 instructions)

### 2. **multiply_by_5.s** (4 instructions)
```assembly
slli x2, x1, 1    # x2 = 2*x1
slli x3, x1, 1    # x3 = 2*x1 (redundant!)
add x2, x2, x3    # x2 = 4*x1
add x2, x2, x1    # x2 = 5*x1
```
**Optimal**: `slli x3, x1, 2; add x2, x3, x1` (2 instructions)

### 3. **double_negate.s** (4 instructions)
```assembly
xori x2, x1, -1    # x2 = ~x1
addi x3, x2, 1     # x3 = -x1
xori x4, x3, -1    # x4 = ~(-x1)
addi x5, x4, 1     # x5 = x1
```
**Optimal**: `add x5, x1, x0` (1 instruction) - simple copy
**Verified**: Optimizer found `xori x2, x1, -1; xori x5, x2, -1` (2 instructions)

### 4. **zero_upper.s** (2 instructions)
```assembly
slli x2, x1, 16    # Shift left 16
srli x2, x2, 16    # Shift right logical 16
```
**Note**: Already optimal without large immediate support

### 5. **sign_extend_byte.s** (2 instructions)
```assembly
slli x2, x1, 24    # Shift left 24
srai x2, x2, 24    # Shift right arithmetic 24
```
**Note**: Already optimal for sign extension

### 6. **check_power_of_2.s** (3 instructions)
```assembly
addi x3, x1, -1    # x3 = x1 - 1
and x4, x1, x3     # x4 = x1 & (x1-1)
sltiu x2, x4, 1    # x2 = (x4 == 0)
```
**Note**: Efficient power-of-2 check using bit manipulation

## Results

### What Works:
✅ All RV32IM instructions implemented correctly
✅ Simulator produces correct results
✅ Equivalence checking works
✅ Cost model correctly counts instructions
✅ Parser and printer handle the instruction set

### Issues Found:
1. **Search Performance**: The optimizer drivers fail with permission errors when run in parallel
2. **Search Effectiveness**: Even when running, the search doesn't find obvious optimizations
3. **Limited Immediate Values**: The constant pool only has {0, 1, -1, -2, -8}, limiting optimizations

### Successful Optimization:
The optimizer DID find one optimization for double_negate:
- Original: 4 instructions (xori, addi, xori, addi)
- Found: 2 instructions (xori, xori)
- Optimal: 1 instruction (add/copy)

## Recommendations

### To improve optimization success:
1. **Expand constant pool**: Add more useful constants (powers of 2, common masks)
2. **Fix parallel execution**: Debug the permission issues with driver processes
3. **Tune search parameters**: Adjust mutation rates and search strategies
4. **Add instruction patterns**: Implement pattern-based rewrites for common idioms
5. **Use symbolic search**: For small programs, exhaustive symbolic search might work better

### Programs that SHOULD optimize:
- `multiply_by_5.s`: 4→2 instructions (verified manually)
- `double_negate.s`: 4→1 instruction (partially found)
- `swap_naive.s`: Could potentially use XOR swap (same cost)

## Conclusion
The RV32IM implementation is complete and correct. The superoptimizer framework works but needs tuning to effectively find optimizations. The main bottleneck is the search algorithm effectiveness, not the ISA implementation.
